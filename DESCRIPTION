Description: Seasonally-local, hot-deck-based simulated sample path forecasting 
    and multiple imputation for daily data with yearly seasonality.
    The basic idea is to behave similarly to a climatology model 
    (i.e. use the average and spread of historical observations for a particular 
    day of the year as the forecast), but operate on a sliding window.
